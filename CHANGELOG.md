# Changelog

All notable changes to pi-munchkin are documented here. Releases follow semantic versioning.

## Unreleased

Brought current 2026-08-05 (had been stale since 2026-07-22 and still described since-deleted
candidates as dark). Net changes since 0.3.0; the full per-decision record is
`optimizer/docs/DARK_CANDIDATE_VERDICTS_2026-08-03.md` and the ledger.

### Added

- **Semantic failure-episode instrument (2026-08-05):** failures classified into a stable
  taxonomy and tracked as episodes keyed by (class, tool family, hashed target, hashed plan
  item). `LOOP_EPISODE_MODE=shadow` (default) records tier observations only (7/11/28 session
  tail, 2/4/6 semantic ladder); `enforce` stays dark behind a separate adoption gate.
  `/loop-status`, `/loop-resume`; private hashed recovery receipts. Calibration prereg:
  `optimizer/docs/PREREG_FAILURE_EPISODE_BASELINE_2026-08.md` (prepared, not approved).
- **`runtime-truth` extension (2026-08-05):** per-request provider timing (headers /
  first-token / stream / settlement ms + status only) after `agent_settled`, and
  `/munchkin-doctor` — a redacted Pi/model/tool-provenance/sandbox posture report.
- MLX serving backends are first-class in the optimizer's serving fingerprint
  (`mlx_lm server`; full-artifact hash, runtime identity via lsof) — first exercised by
  `audit-sweep`'s first-ever round (`maple20b-audit-base`, ledger 2026-08-05).

- **Adopted, default-on (2026-08-03/04, human-gated):** `session-blackboard` state lens
  (default mode `steer` since 2026-08-04; `STATE_LENS=off|view|both`), `teach-hints`
  (`TEACH_HINTS=off`), `did-you-mean` (`DID_YOU_MEAN=off`), and `tool-activation`
  (dynamic deferred `subagent`/`compact_context`; `MUNCHKIN_TOOL_ACTIVATION=ambient` reverts).
- `session-blackboard` cockpit (human-only HTML/TUI), `tool-call-rescue` (dark,
  `TOOL_CALL_RESCUE=on`), `bash-output-guard` (dark, `BASH_OUTPUT_GUARD=on`),
  `SPAWN_DELEGATION` (dark).
- Operational automation (2026-08-04): `npm run secret-scan:diff`, `npm run mirror:check`,
  `surface:hash:source`, compat/peer smoke checks, CI workflow, and
  `docs/SURFACE_BOUNDARIES.md` — the canonical surface-hash boundary ledger.
- Optimizer instrument (now mothballed with it): graded `subscores` +
  `effort_report --graded`, manifest-pinned grade artifacts, admission approval pinned to
  manifest content, the `audit-sweep` graded fixture.

### Changed

- `verify-gate` hardened: anchored gate-command matching, POSIX `test` builtin no longer
  disarms, three-state verification classifier (2026-08-04), state published fresh and
  cleared per session.
- `loop-breaker`: session-cumulative grinding counter; steer anchor dropped on
  `agent_start`; rejected `plan_write`s now count as failing outcomes, not progress.
- `plan-runner`: `plan_go` tool + `/plan-go` unified on one validator; `__pi_active_plan_context`
  and `partialWorkNoted` correctly session-scoped; rejected gates clear the shared green latch.
- `hashline`: bounded read/edit preflight (16 MiB); hex tags only.

### Removed

- The `plan-weaver` (v4) extension and its `plan-contract` lib (ported into plan-runner).
- **Retired candidates (2026-07-31 and 2026-08-03, each on its own pre-registered grounds):**
  Tier 0 (c1/c5/c8/c9/c15 — structurally inert), c33, the c40–c45 planner family, c7, c14
  (slug tags, with `tag-words.ts`), c32 (sha-guard), c37 (`PLAN_DELEGATE_ALL`), c50
  (`spec-adherence` extension). Their result rows remain as history.
- The optimizer is **mothballed** (`optimizer/docs/MOTHBALLED_2026-08-03.md`) — code and data
  retained, no longer the default path.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Release-ready npm metadata, a reproducible lockfile, and Linux/macOS CI on Node 22.
- `plan-weaver` and `did-you-mean` to the default extension set.
- The bundled `pi-subagent` extension to the package manifest.
- Canonical `test`, `typecheck`, `health`, `pack:smoke`, and `verify` commands.
- Package-content and extension-load smoke coverage before release.

### Changed

- Type-checking now covers the complete harness from a normal root `npm ci`; it no longer relies on user-specific absolute symlinks.
- The health check is read-only and works in both a clean clone and an installed harness with local configuration.

### Security

- The fault-injection-only `chaos` extension and policy are excluded from the published artifact and default manifest.
- CI uses read-only repository permissions.

## 0.2.0

- Previous development release of the harness and measurement-gated optimizer.
